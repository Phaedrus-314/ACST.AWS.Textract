# Amazon Web Services Credentials File used by AWS CLI, SDKs, and tools
# This file was created by the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code extension.
#
# Your AWS credentials are represented by access keys associated with IAM users.
# For information about how to create and manage AWS access keys for a user, see:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html
#
# This credential file can store multiple access keys by placing each one in a
# named "profile". For information about how to change the access keys in a 
# profile or to add a new profile with a different access key, see:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html

# The access key and secret key pair identify your account and grant access to AWS.

# Treat your secret key like a password. Never share your secret key with anyone. Do 
# not post it in online forums, or store it in a source control system. If your secret 
# key is ever disclosed, immediately use IAM to delete the access key and secret key
# and create a new key pair. Then, update this file with the replacement key details.
