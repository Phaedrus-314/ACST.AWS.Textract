Cool.  So, to my Q way below.  Can we make the mapper split out to two folders?  One for 
ClaimsNeedingReview and one for ClaimsWithConfidence?  Then can you make the Viewer have a toolbar 
button to just dump all ClaimsWithConfidence straight into BTS without having to review them? 

For setting confidence levels...where is that done?  Is it done by hacking a bunch of behind the scenes
names coodinates files?  Can it just be a simple screen added to the GUI that they can change anytime 
they want?  We want to make this as easily “user” configurable as we can so they don’t have to keep 
harassing us for things they can do themselves.  And, if things aren’t “easy” they won’t do it…LOL.

I know the viewer knows what fields are mandatory, because it makes you fix them.  Can you add another 
“REQ” column to the bottom fields grids that contains an asterisk for required fields so they can 
visually see as they go thru rather than waiting until the end to clean them up.  Also, when there
are no errors it tells you about success on saving.  But, if there were any errors before that it
still displays error msg and (I think) doesn’t tell you it was a successful save after fixing them.

 PROVIDER MATCH: 
Another Q from the girls.  What is your logic for matching Dental providers when EdiAutomation runs.  
It needs to get the FeeTier (tblProviderGroups) when xferring to claims.  
It needs to try to find a Cigna Dental (or, not NonPar) provider and feetier 1st, then 
try NonPar (Blank Group), then lastly create any missing ones as NonPar.
